# Musical tone (Plan-english)

By *computational(digital) music analysis* the first basic knowledge is a **musical tone**. The musical tone will be hier explained and visualised from different dimensions:

- Physic  

- Mathematic

- Music theory


**Musical tone** is a periodic sound, characterised by:

- Duration

- Pitch

- Loudness(intecity)

- Timbre(Ton quality)

## 1. Complexity of a tone

 Every tone is a complex tone. Complex tone - combination of many simple periodic waves(pure tones), harmonically related.

- Harmonic series (Physic)

  - circle motion

  - waveform

- Partials (Music theory)

- Harmonic analysis (Mathematic)

  - Trigonometric polinomial, derivatives (Realplane)

  - complexe plane, vector(Linear Algebra), fourier coefficient

  - fourieseries
     > "any periodic waveform can be approximated as a sum of a serias of sinusoidal (sine,cosine) waves" (Furier theorem)

  - Furier transform - Frequenz domain of a ton 

## 2. Intencity

- Pegel(Physic, Elektronic)

- Hearing pressure, Loudness (Physic, ear anatomy)

- Dinamic (Music theory)

## 3. Timbre (Quality)

- Harmonic scale (Music theory)

- Fermanten by harmonic series, fermanten(Physic)

- Instruments

## 4. Duration

- Time , Envelope (Physic)

- Noteduration (Musciktheory)

## 5. Notesystem is based on the harmonic series

- partialscale (Physic)

- Tonsystem (Musictheory, Physic)

- Tunning

- Scale
