# Musical tone (Plan-english)

By *digital music analysis* the first basic knowledge is a **musical tone**. The musical tone will be hier explained and visualised from different dimensions:

- Physic  

- Mathematic

- Music theory

**Musical tone** is a periodic sound, characterised by his:

- Duration

- Pitch

- Loudness(intecity)

- Timbre(Ton quality)

## 1. Complexity of a tone

 Every tone is a complex tone. Complex tone - combination of many simple periodic waves(pure tones), harmonically related.

### 1.1 Pitch 

- waveform, Frequency (Hz)

### 1.2 Harmonic series 

- circle motion (Physic)

- Partials (Music theory)

- Harmonic analysis (Mathematic)

- Trigonometric polinomial, derivatives (Realplane)

- complexe plane, vector(Linear Algebra), fourier coefficient

- fourieseries
     > "any periodic waveform can be approximated as a sum of a serias of sinusoidal (sine,cosine) waves" (Furier theorem)

- Furier transform - Frequenz domain of a ton 


## 2. Intencity

- Pegel(Physic, Elektronic)

- Hearing pressure, Loudness (Physic, ear anatomy)

- Dinamic (Music theory)

## 3. Timbre (Quality)

- Harmonic scale (Music theory)

- Fermanten by harmonic series, fermanten(Physic)

- Instruments

## 4. Duration

- Time , Envelope (Physic)

- Noteduration (Musciktheory)
